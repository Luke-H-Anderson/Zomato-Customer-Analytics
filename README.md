# Zomato-Customer-Analytics
This is another project I created while studying at TripleTen.

The purpose of the project was to discover key insights of Zomato's customer base and report it.
The specific characteristics I decided to focus on where the gender demographics, montly income level, and the number of orders by family size.

# Dashboard
The dashboard is very interactive and consists of four charts.

The first if a bar graph of the number of orders over the four years in which the data was collected.

The second, another bar graph showing the different family sizes and how many orders customers of those
family sizes ordered. It is interactive, so if you click on any of the bars, such as the One bar, it will
alter the information on the two next charts.

The third chart is a simple pie chart that splits our customer base into male or female.
Should you choose to, this pie chart can also be used as a filter for the data. Simply click on the male or female 
slice and the data will be filtered to only show what fits within the parameter of your choosing.

Lastly, there is a fourth chart that shows the income level of all customers on a monthly basis. Click any of the bars of your choosing, 
and it will filter the previous two charts to reflect the parameter chosen.

With all of that said, this dashboard can be used to find different, such as how many male customers have a family of two; 
what is the monthly income level of females? Or how many males, with a family size of one, have a monthly income of at least $10,000?
